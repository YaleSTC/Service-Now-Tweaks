Service-Now-Tweaks
==================

STC Service Now Tweaks is a Chrome Extension which improves the
experience of using Service Now for students employed by the Yale
Student Technology Collaborative.

Modifications
------
- Descriptive tooltips appear for form item labels on the "New Incident" page

ToDo
------
- Pressing 'enter' within Short Description should automatically search
  for a knowledge article (tab should still go to the next field like
    usual.
- The title of the ticket should appear at the top in the blue bar
- The student's NetID should appear directly on the incident page
  somehow
- Next to Client Name, there should be an icon which links to the Yale
  Facebook entry for that person. Perhaps this could even appear as a
  tooltip?
